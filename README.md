# Hospital Pricing Frontend

This is the React frontend for Hospital Pricing
deployed at https://hospital-pricing-dashboard.herokuapp.com

The entire application uses React and Express with a Postgres database.

This website is a tool for users to compare prices for various procedures at different hospitals.

Users can search by hospitals or by procedures. Results can be sorted by name or by cost.  Additional information is provided for both hospitals and procedures.

The typical user would search for either the hospital or procedure they are interested in, and then can sort the costs of procedures to make decisions on where to seek care.

To run this:

    npm start
